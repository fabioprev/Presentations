	\textbf{Predictions} suggest that by 2050 there will be around \textbf{100 million} cases. \\

	If \textbf{intervention} could \textbf{achieve} even a \textbf{modest} one year \textbf{delay} of
	both disease onset and progression, there would be nearly \textbf{9 million fewer} cases of the
	disease by that time. \\
