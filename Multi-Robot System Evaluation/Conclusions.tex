	\begin{itemize}
		\item Basic survey on how MRS are evaluated
		
		\item Analyzed four works
		
		\item In general I have seen that
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item the majority of the works are simulated
			
			\item few of them use a real robot
			
			\item rarely found works that use a network simulator
		\end{itemize}
