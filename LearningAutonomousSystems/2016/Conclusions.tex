	We presented an \textbf{effective} framework for \textbf{predicting} future agent motions of
	goal-oriented agents in a variety of interactive multi-agent settings, based on \emph{PTracking} a
	novel \textbf{real-time} distributed tracker.

	\underline{\textbf{Main contributions}}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Real-time, accurate and precise tracking
		\item Fully scalable design
		\item Prediction without prior annotation of scene semantics
		\item Non-uniform grids for state representation
		\item Efficient and scalable for on-robot implementation
	\end{itemize}
