	\frametitle{Motivation}
	
	\Large
	
	\vspace{0.2cm}
	
	The cause of the Alzheimer's disease is still \textbf{poorly understood} and to date \textbf{no
	treatment} to stop or reverse its progression has been discovered.
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	In developed countries, the Alzheimer's disease is one of the most \textbf{financially costly}
	diseases due to \textbf{continuous treatments} as well as the \textbf{need} of assistance or
	supervision in daily activities.

	\vspace{0.1cm}
	
	The objective of this work is to present an \textbf{automated approach} for classifying the
	Alzheimer's disease from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) patient brain scans.
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	The method is \textbf{fast} and \textbf{reliable} for a suitable and \textbf{straightforward
	deploy} in clinical applications for helping diagnosing and improving the efficacy of medical
	treatments by recognising the disease state of the patient.

	\vspace{0.2cm}
	
	We report the comparison on \textbf{two established} medical data sets (ADNI and OASIS).
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	In binary classification, our proposed approach \textbf{outperforms} most state-of-the-art
	techniques, while having comparable results with the others.
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	When dealing with three or four classes (i.e., all subjects) our method is the \textbf{only one}
	that reaches \textbf{remarkable} performance, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.
